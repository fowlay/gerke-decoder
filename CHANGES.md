
Version 1.8:

DONE: Spikes and dips removal based on the integral of squared
deviation from threshold, instead of just duration.

spikes removal. This curve is drawn at the bottom edge of the plot and
visualizes the input to the decoding procedure.


Version 1.7:

DONE: Ensure text buffer is flushed also if the analysis stops in the
middle of a dash or a dot.
