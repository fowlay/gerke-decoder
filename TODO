Refactoring

Identify truly global variables and arrays. Break up the big main
function into procedures that operate on those. Have threading in
mind.



Consistency

Option -w (WPM) defines TU

Option -q (sample period) defines a fraction of TU, should be rounded
to an integer number of wav samples. This integer to be used in
calculation of times, and a re-adjusted tsLength parameter.

Break superlong dashes: Do not break in half, instead break off 3+1 TU
and reconsider the remaining dash for possibly another breakup. Also
distribute the collected weight fairly, even though it will not be
used.




Performance

Maybe make the floor detection a bit more localized.

Make the post-filter smoothing action properly scaled.

Consider running the filters on separate threads.

Do not exit before gnuplot subprocesses have terminated.

Quantify the performance gain obtained by digital filtering. Use the
2019-12-24 material.

Tests on the super-noisy synchronous RSCW sample: Done, no success.


Logistics

Release identifier

Code in 3 places, should be one or two. Generate a Java interface
class to hold the value, taken from the pom.xml?

Extension

Processing of I/Q data. Multiply with a single sine wave, then filter,
then combine the two channels by square root of amplitudes.
